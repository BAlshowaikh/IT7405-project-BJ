# CoHub – Personal Task Management Web Application

CoHub is a web-based task management application developed using **Python, Django, and MongoDB**. The system allows users to manage personal tasks, track productivity, and save helpful tips, with a clean and responsive user interface.

This project was developed as part of a university coursework to demonstrate NoSQL database usage, Django architecture, and full-stack web application development.

## 🧩 Architecture

The application follows Django’s **Model–View–Template (MVT)** architecture:

- **Models** define MongoDB document structures (Task, Tip)
- **Views** handle business logic using class-based and function-based views
- **Templates** render dynamic HTML using Django Template Language

Djongo enables Django models to map directly to MongoDB documents, allowing seamless NoSQL integration.
